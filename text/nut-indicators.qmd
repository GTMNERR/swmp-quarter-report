The state thresholds used in the chlorophyll *a*, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus visualizations come from Florida State Surface Water Quality Standards within the Florida Administrative Code.

## Summary

Waters at all stations were oxygenated following spring rainfall events and Nor'easters (@fig-rainfall-2; @fig-do); however, dissolved oxygen was lower than average from late January through mid-March at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek and again at the end July at Pine Island (@fig-do-1; @fig-do-2). This pattern is likely correlated with the warmer than average temperatures this area experienced during this time (@fig-range-atemp; @fig-range-temp). Pellicer Creek had daily average dissolved oxygen values that fell within normal ranges (@fig-do-4), however continuous data show low dissolved oxygen values in several months: June, July, August, and September (@fig-do-pc). Pine Island has experienced very low dissolved oxygen values (less than 2 mg/L) frequently in the past two years, which is uncharacteristic for this station, particularly in the past five years (@fig-do-pi). This August was especially pronounced with prolonged periods in poor conditions (@fig-do-pi-2). @tbl-pc-do and @tbl-pi-do show the hypoxia events and duration (more than 0.5 hrs) at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek for this year.

Chlorophyll *a* values were higher than average at all stations from January through May (@fig-chla-boxplots), frequently over the state thresholds. Although too soon to make inferences, so far the data shows elevated annual geometric means of chlorophyll *a* at all stations except Fort Matanzas (@fig-chla-agm). Chlorophyll *a* at Pine Island continues to remain exceptionally high with this year seeing record monthly high values for January (7.0 $\mu$g/L), March (9.8 $\mu$g/L), and September (12 $\mu$g/L).

Interpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated. At Pine Island and Pellicer Creek, however, high TN was observed in the high rainfall months of July and August (@fig-tn-boxplots). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) was lower than average for most stations; however, all stations experienced higher levels in May and August (@fig-tkn-boxplots).

Total phosphorus continues to fall below the state threshold for every station and similar to TKN, all stations experienced elevated values of total phosphorus and orthophosphate in May (@fig-tp-boxplots; @fig-po4-boxplots). Relatively high levels of orthophosphate were observed at Pine Island January through May and again in August (@fig-po4-boxplots).

Pellicer Creek is located within a waterbody with known impairments for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll *a*, and fecal coliform bacteria. As such, this station frequently experiences low dissolved oxygen values, particularly in the summer months (@fig-do-pc).

### Nitrogen

#### Total Nitrogen

TN is calculated by adding TKN and NO23.

Several of the NO23 values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab's minimum detection limit and therefore TN was not able to be calculated and is missing for quite a few months at all the stations (@fig-tn-boxplots). This was especially true at Fort Matanzas which has the least amount of TN data (@fig-tn-boxplots-3).

#### Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen

DIN is calculated by adding NO23 and ammonia (NH4). Due to the low or undetectable levels of NO23, DIN is also missing quite a bit of information (@fig-din-boxplots).
