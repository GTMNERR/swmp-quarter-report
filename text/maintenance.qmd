## Sonde Failure in Field

One sonde failure ("Irma" SN: 20H100465) and multiple sensor failures (3 Wiped CT, 1 DO, 1 Turbidity, and 1 Central Wiper) occurred during this quarter. The datasonde will need to be sent in for repair as one of the sensor pins was sheared off in the bulkhead - likely due to excessive power draw from the Central Wiper, coupled with electrolysis. Sensors will all need to be either evaluated (turbidity, central wiper) or replaced (WCT, DO).
