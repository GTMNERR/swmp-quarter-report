    "text": "Understanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

    "text": "1.2 Locations\nThe climate of Northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions.

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at www.nerrsdata.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Grab samples were collected from all stations in duplicate using a pole sampler and bucket. Diel samples were only collected at the Pellicer Creek station at 2.5-hour intervals for a 25-hour (lunar day) period using a Teledyne ISCO automatic sampler equipped with an internal ice bath to keep samples cold.

In 2022, the GTM Research Reserve weather station recorded much higher rainfall in the first quarter than the previous five years (Figure 4.1 (a)). The majority of this rainfall occurred during the month of March with approximately 200 mm (7.87 in) of rain (Figure 4.1 (b)).\nThe summer months were rather dry with no “extremely wet” days of rainfall (>30mm) and very few “very wet” days (20-29mm). In fact, mid-July through mid-August saw almost a month with no rainfall (Figure 4.1 (c)). Regular rain resumed in late August into September concluding with extreme rainfall during Hurricane Ian, which resulted in the largest amount of monthly rainfall for 2022 occurring in September with 400 mm (15.7 in) of rain.\nEven though another tropical cyclone event occurred in November (Hurricane Nicole), the fourth quarter rainfall levels were still within similar amounts to the previous few years (Figure 4.1 (a)). The majority of the rainfall in November was associated with Hurricane Nicole and December had the least amount of rain all year, with only 3 days of very little rain (Figure 4.1 (c)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Ongoing quarterly totals of precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Current year monthly total precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Daily rainfall totals for days with more than 1mm of day.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Rainfall at the Pellicer Creek weather station."

The most variable ranges occurred in the first quarter of the year and then several distinctive drops in average temperature were observed in the last quarter associated with storm events (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Nicole, and nor’easters).\nFreezing temperatures are of great interest in Northeast Florida because the region is a climatic transition zone experiencing a shift in foundational vegetation species associated with temperature. Salt marsh grasses are outcompeted by mangrove trees/shrubs in the absence of freezes, which limit mangrove persistence. Mangrove coverage has continued to increase throughout Northeast Florida from an estimated four acres in 1990 to almost 3,000 acres in 2014 (Dix et al. 2021). Cavanaugh et al. (2013) observed an ecological threshold of -4 °C, where mangrove cover decreased in years that experienced temperatures below -4 °C. Prior to this year, temperatures at the weather station only fell below -4 °C on two days: January 24, 2003(for 6.5 hours, the longest duration below this threshold) and December 14, 2010. This year, temperatures fell below -4°C early on the morning of December 25th for 3 hours (Figure 4.2 (b)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, every one of the freeze events (2003, 2010, and this year) occurred in the early morning hours between 4-8am.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Historical daily range of air temperature at the SWMP weather station with current year daily average overlaid in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Continuous, 15-min air temperature values between December 23-27, 2022 with air temperature values recorded below -4 degrees Celsius, threshold provided with a dashed horizontal line, indicated in red.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Air temperature recoreded at the SWMP weather station.\n\n\nSimilar to air temperature, water temperature was also quite variable in the first quarter of the year (January - March), where daily averages were much lower in February, but the following month in March ended up being higher than average (Figure 4.3). Water temperatures do not experience the range in values that are observed in the air, however, similar observable drops in temperature in the early and late parts of the year are visible (Figure 4.3).\nThese higher than average daily values were likely driven up by the large amounts of rainfall this area experienced during this time (Figure 4.1 (b)). Beginning in the latter part of May through the entire summer, waters were much warmer than average, particularly in the shallower sites (Figure 4.3 (a); Figure 4.3 (d)). There was an observable drop in water temperatures at all sites during the time Hurricane Ian struck the Florida peninsula in late September, but temperatures climbed back into their “normal” range after the storm passed at all sites except Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.3), which is a shallow creek and more influenced by upland runoff.

Values were much lower (some even below threshold levels) at all sites in the last quarter of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Annual geometric means of monthly chlorophyll a at each SWMP water quality station. Horizontal dashed blue line indicates the state threshold, as found in F.A.C 62-302.530. Values exceeding the threshold are indicated in red. The 2022 value is based upon data to date and does not equal an entire year of data.\n\n\nUsing methods from Cloern and Jassby (2010), variability and patterns in the monthly chlorophyll a data were further extracted by decomposing the timeseries at each station using Equation 4 into an annual effect, mean seasonal pattern, and residual “events”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 4 from Cloern and Jassby (2010):\n\n\n\n\\[\nc_{ij}=Cy_im_j\\epsilon_{ij}\n\\] Where \\(c_{ij}\\) is chlorophyll concentration in year \\(i\\)(\\(i=1,...,N\\)) and month \\(j\\)(\\(j=1,...12\\)); C is the long-term mean of the series; \\(y_i\\) is the annual effect in the ith year; \\(m_j\\) is the seasonal (monthly) effect in the jth month; and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual.\n\nIf \\(y_i\\) >1, indicates a year with above-average mean Chl-a.\nIf \\(m_j\\) >1, indicates a mean monthly Chl-a greater than the annual mean.\nIf \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) >1, indicates an observation greater than the expected value for that month and year.\n\n\n\nBased on these methods, Pine Island has observed higher annual chlorophyll a in the past three years. Additionally, the five months in 2022 in which the highest monthly values of chlorophyll a were recorded were identified in the residual “events” that were high, they were not the highest deviations in the timeseries; that value occurred in 2015 (Figure 5.5). All other stations observed lower annual variability in 2022 and each station shows a distinctive seasonal pattern with the highest values occurring from April through August, particularly at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek (?fig-chla-decomp). San Sebastian and Fort Matanzas, likely due to their proximity to inlets, appear to have a more protracted season which further extends into October (Figure 5.6; Figure 5.7).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Phytoplankton variability at each of the four SWMP water quality stations.

    "text": "5.3 Nitrogen\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated (see below). However, there is a pattern in total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) at all sites (Figure 5.11). At Pine Island, there are very low values between January-March and elevated levels from April-July (Figure 5.11 (a)). This distinctive shift between March and April may likely be in response to the large amounts of rainfall the system experienced in March (Figure 4.1 (b)). This response was seen at all the other sites, especially Pellicer Creek, which is also a more brackish site and sensitive to upland freshwater deposition (Figure 5.11 (b)).\nThere was enough data in the last quarter of the year at Pine Island to show high TN values in September, which exceeded the threshold, though fell within normal ranges for that month (Figure 5.9 (a)). High TN in April at Pellicer Creek, coupled with the high chlorophyll a values in this same time, could be a consequence of the large rain the area experienced during March (Figure 4.1 (b); Figure 5.9 (d)).\nAll DIN above detection limit were reported less than 0.1 (mg/L) at all sites for all months this year. The higher values appear to be in months following large rain events such as October at Pellicer Creek (Figure 5.10 (d)) and in April at San Sebastian (Figure 5.10 (b)) and Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.10 (c)).\n\n5.3.1 Total Nitrogen\nTN is a calculated value based on TKN and NO23.\nThis year, several of the NO23 values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab’s minimum detection limit and therefore TN was not able to be calculated and is missing for quite a few months at all the stations (Figure 5.9). This was especially true at Fort Matanzas which has the least amount of TN data (Figure 5.9 (c)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Historical monthly total nitrogen at each SWMP water quality station with current year monthly value overlaid in red.

Unlike storms Matthew and Irma in the past (Figure 7.3), there was no observable singular storm surge event that occurred with Hurricane Ian, but increasing water levels over several tidal cycles (Figure 7.4). It took three tide cycles until maximum water levels were reached when the storm was closest to the reserve. For most stations, the amount of water at the incoming tide was close to double what was receding at the outgoing tide. The greatest increase in water depth was observed in Pellicer Creek where there was an overall gain of 1.31m (4.3ft) in the creek. After the storm’s passing, the water levels quickly dropped with each falling tide over the next two days (Figure 7.4).\nUnfortunately, due to suspected sensor drift on an aging data sonde and the depth reading at post deployment differing from depth offset for calibrations, the depth data for Pine Island was marked suspect during quarterly review between 09/27/2022 12:30 pm EST and 09/30/2022 11:45 pm EST (October data began a new quarter and has therefore not undergone review).

For the two stations furthest away from the inlets (Pine Island and Pellicer Creek), salinity started to increase with each tidal cycle starting on Wednesday, September 28th, 2022. The predominating northeasterly winds along the northeast Florida coast at this time largely fought falling tides, trapping more salty, ocean waters within the estuary.\nAll sites experienced drops in salinity as the storm passed, but the greatest effect was in Pellicer Creek where salinity dropped to 0psu (fresh water) for four days before any observable rise in salinity was observed by the station. Quite a bit of freshwater movement and draining from the watershed is observable at the other three stations in the days after the storm (Figure 7.5). Large changes (peaks and drops) in salinity at Fort Matanzas is most likely due to the influence of Pellicer Creek, the largest freshwater source to the Matanzas Estuary, as well as the proximity of this site to the Matanzas Inlet (4 km north). The Pine Island station appeared to have increased in salinity with the storm and then fell back to pre-storm levels within a day and a half after the storm’s passing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Continuous salinity at all four water quality stations of the GTMNERR during the time period of Hurricane Ian, September 28 - October 2, 2022.

    "text": "7.5 Recovery\nA large note to make when investigating recovery time frames is that not long after the passing of the hurricane, northeast Florida experienced seasonal “king tide” events, which regularly occur in the fall months (primarily October) and lead to higher than high tides. This effect largely impacts the ability to fully assess the “recovery” of the system after the hurricane. However, observing potential recovery within two weeks after the storm revealed that many sites did return to pre-storm values or ranges (Table 7.1).\nDissolved oxygen at many stations increased with the storm and remained high for several days following the storm. Preceding the storm, much of the estuary was experiencing lower values of dissolved oxygen. The storm appeared to have reoxygenated the waterways, though both Fort Matanzas and San Sebastian experienced a drop in the day after the storm, which then climbed back up to pre-storm levels within a few days. For Pine Island, the dissolved oxygen remained high after the storm and hasn’t fallen back to pre-storm patterns.\nAlthough pre-storm salinity values were reached not long after the storm passed at San Sebastian and Fort Matanzas, the tidal range of salinity did not resume pre-storm patterns until over a week had passed after the storm. This was likely largely driven by the excess freshwater in the estuary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1:  Number of days it took to return to pre-storm values/patterns after the passing of Hurricane Ian at all four water quality stations in the GTM Research Reserve. \n \n  \n    Station \n    Salinity \n    Dissolved Oxygen \n    Depth \n  \n \n\n  \n    Pine Island \n    1 \n    NA \n    1 \n  \n  \n    San Sebastian \n    11 \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Fort Matanzas \n    12 \n    4 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Pellicer Creek \n    12 \n    10 \n    13"

This reset the depth data and the station resumed reporting and transmission to NOAA HADS an hour after the maintenance was performed. Discussions occurred regarding whether this depth drop out (which has been observed sporadically before) could be caused by the telemetry connection, or the program not being able to accommodate non-SWMP tier 1 parameters/sensors: e.g. Total Algae and fDOM."
