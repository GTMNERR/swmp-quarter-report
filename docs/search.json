    "text": "5.3 Nitrogen\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated (see below). However, total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) show distinctive patterns at all sites (Figure 5.7). At Pine Island, there is a distinctive pattern of very low values between January-March and elevated levels from April-July (Figure 5.7 (a)). This distinctive shift between March and April may likely be in response to the large levels of rainfall the system experienced in March (Figure 4.1 (b)). This response was seen at all the other sites, especially Pellicer Creek, which is also a more brackish site and sensitive to upland freshwater deposition (Figure 5.7 (b)).\n\n5.3.1 Total Nitrogen\nTN is a calculated value based on TKN and NO23.\nThis year, quite a bit of the NO23 values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab’s minimum detection limit and therefore TN was not able to be calculated.
