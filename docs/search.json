The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions. The weather station is located near the mouth of Pellicer Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: SWMP Water Quality Stations"

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at www.nerrsdata.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

    "text": "5.3 Nitrogen\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated (see below). However, total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) show distinctive patterns at all sites (Figure 5.7). At Pine Island, there is a distinctive pattern of very low values between January-March and elevated levels from April-July (Figure 5.7 (a)). This distinctive shift between March and April may likely be in response to the large levels of rainfall the system experienced in March (Figure 4.1 (b)). This response was seen at all the other sites, especially Pellicer Creek, which is also a more brackish site and sensitive to upland freshwater deposition (Figure 5.7 (b)).\n\n5.3.1 Total Nitrogen\nTN is a calculated value based on TKN and NO23.\nThis year, quite a bit of the NO23 values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab’s minimum detection limit and therefore TN was not able to be calculated.
