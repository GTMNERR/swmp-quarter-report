    "text": "Understanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

Discrete water samples are collected monthly for nutrients and other parameters at these same four stations, with an additional diel sampler deployed at one station. To complement the water quality data, the GTMNERR also operates and maintains one continuous meteorological station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll SWMP data are publicly available for download through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO).

    "text": "1.2 Locations\nThe climate of Northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions.

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at www.nerrsdata.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Unlike storms Matthew and Irma in the past (Figure 6.3), there was no observable singular storm surge event that occurred with Hurricane Ian, but increasing water levels over several tidal cycles (Figure 6.4). It took three tide cycles until maximum water levels were reached when the storm was closest to the reserve. For most stations, the amount of water at the incoming tide was close to double what was receding at the outgoing tide. The greatest increase in water depth was observed in Pellicer Creek where there was an overall gain of 1.31m (4.3ft) in the creek. After the storm’s passing, the water levels quickly dropped with each falling tide over the next two days (Figure 6.4).\nUnfortunately, due to suspected sensor drift on an aging data sonde and the depth reading at post deployment differing from depth offset for calibrations, the depth data for Pine Island was marked suspect during quarterly review between 09/27/2022 12:30 pm EST and 09/30/2022 11:45 pm EST (October data began a new quarter and has therefore not undergone review).

    "text": "6.4 A loaded freshwater system\nBetween the increasing water levels before the storm and the heavy rainfall with it, the salinity at all the water quality stations was quite variable (Figure 6.5). For the two stations furthest away from the inlets (Pine Island and Pellicer Creek), salinity started to increase with each tidal cycle starting on Wednesday, September 28th, 2022. The predominating northeasterly winds along the northeast Florida coast at this time largely fought falling tides, trapping more salty, ocean waters within the estuary.\nAll sites experienced drops in salinity as the storm passed, but the greatest effect was in Pellicer Creek where salinity dropped to 0psu (fresh water) for four days before any observable rise in salinity was observed by the station. Quite a bit of freshwater movement and draining from the watershed is observable at the other three stations in the days after the storm (Figure 6.5). Large changes (peaks and drops) in salinity at Fort Matanzas is most likely due to the influence of Pellicer Creek, the largest freshwater source to the Matanzas Estuary, as well as the proximity of this site to the Matanzas Inlet (4 km north). The Pine Island station appeared to have increased in salinity with the storm and then fell back to pre-storm levels within a day and a half after the storm’s passing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Continuous salinity at all four water quality stations of the GTMNERR during the time period of Hurricane Ian, September 28 - October 2, 2022.

    "section": "6.5 Recovery",
    "text": "6.5 Recovery\nA large note to make when investigating recovery time frames is that not long after the passing of the hurricane, northeast Florida experienced seasonal “king tide” events, which regularly occur in the fall months (primarily October) and lead to higher than high tides. This effect largely impacts the ability to fully assess the “recovery” of the system after the hurricane. However, observing potential recovery within two weeks after the storm revealed that many sites did return to pre-storm values or ranges (Table 6.1).\nDissolved oxygen at many stations increased with the storm and remained high for several days following the storm. Preceding the storm, much of the estuary was experiencing lower values of dissolved oxygen. The storm appeared to have reoxygenated the waterways, though both Fort Matanzas and San Sebastian experienced a drop in the day after the storm, which then climbed back up to pre-storm levels within a few days. For Pine Island, the dissolved oxygen remained high after the storm and hasn’t fallen back to pre-storm patterns.\nAlthough pre-storm salinity values were reached not long after the storm passed at San Sebastian and Fort Matanzas, the tidal range of salinity did not resume pre-storm patterns until over a week had passed after the storm. This was likely largely driven by the excess freshwater in the estuary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1:  Number of days it took to return to pre-storm values/patterns after the passing of Hurricane Ian at all four water quality stations in the GTM Research Reserve. \n \n  \n    Station \n    Salinity \n    Dissolved Oxygen \n    Depth \n  \n \n\n  \n    Pine Island \n    1 \n    NA \n    1 \n  \n  \n    San Sebastian \n    11 \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Fort Matanzas \n    12 \n    4 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    Pellicer Creek \n    12 \n    10 \n    13"

Due to telemetry issues (faulty solar regulator) at this same time, it is likely this was associated with the power comm board failure in the data sonde as it was deployed during the time the telemetry went down (7/16/2022 - 8/5/2022).\nReceived EXO2 datasonde on 10/19/2022 that was sent for service and repair back in August after a failed deployment in the field at Pellicer Creek.

This reset the depth data and the station resumed reporting and transmission to NOAA HADS an hour after the maintenance was performed.
