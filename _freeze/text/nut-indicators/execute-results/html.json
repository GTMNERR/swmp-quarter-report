A distinctive jump in dissolved oxygen occurred at all sites during the storm period of Hurricane Ian (September 28 - October 1, 2022).\n\n\n::: {#fig-do .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pine Island](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-do-1.png){#fig-do-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![San Sebastian](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-do-2.png){#fig-do-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fort Matanzas](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-do-3.png){#fig-do-3 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pellicer Creek](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-do-4.png){#fig-do-4 width=672}\n:::\n\nHistorical daily range of dissolved oxygen at each SWMP water quality station with current year daily average overlaid in blue. Horizontal dashed red line indicates 2mg/L hypoxia threshold.\n:::\n\n\nPellicer Creek is located within a waterbody with known impairments for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll *a*, and fecal coliform bacteria. As such, this station frequently experiences low dissolved oxygen values, particularly in the summer months; this year has been no exception (@fig-do-pc). In fact, the dissolved oxygen in late August was lower than values observed during the time of Hurricane Irma (@fig-do-pc-1). Values began to rise in September, but it is likely that the storm surge associated with Hurricane Ian in late September helped to bring in and further oxygenate this system (@fig-do-pc-2).\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-do-pc .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![For the past five years](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-do-pc-1.png){#fig-do-pc-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![For the current 2022 year](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-do-pc-2.png){#fig-do-pc-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nContinuous dissolved oxygen at Pellicer Creek with monthly average overlaid in solid gray line. Conditions are indicated as good when above 5 mg/L, fair between 2 and 5 mg/L, and poor if less than 2 mg/L.\n:::\n\n\n## Chlorophyll *a*\n\nSo far, this year has seen elevated chlorophyll *a* levels at the three intracoastal waterway sites (@fig-chla-boxplots). The levels have been especially high at Pine Island since April (@fig-chla-boxplots-1); the highest observed chlorophyll in the time series was observed in April this year (18.5 $\\mu$g/L). San Sebastian also had the highest chlorophyll observed in January and Feburary of this year compared to the same months in all previous years (6.85 and 5.6 $\\mu$g/L, respectively; @fig-chla-boxplots-2). High chlorophyll *a* at all stations in January are likely due to uncharacteristically high temperatures that month (@fig-range-temp).\n\nInterestingly, though much higher seasonal chlorophyll was observed at Fort Matanzas in the first quarter, August was much lower than average (@fig-chla-boxplots-3). \n\n\n::: {#fig-chla-boxplots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pine Island](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-chla-boxplots-1.png){#fig-chla-boxplots-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![San Sebastian](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-chla-boxplots-2.png){#fig-chla-boxplots-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fort Matanzas](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-chla-boxplots-3.png){#fig-chla-boxplots-3 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pellicer Creek](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-chla-boxplots-4.png){#fig-chla-boxplots-4 width=672}\n:::\n\nHistorical monthly chlorophyll a at each SWMP water quality station with current year monthly value overlaid in red.

Horizontal dashed blue line indicates the state threshold, as found in F.A.C 62-302.530. Values exceeding the threshold are indicated in red. The 2022 value is based upon data to date and does not equal an entire year of data.\n:::\n\n\n## Nitrogen\n\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated (see below). However, total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) show distinctive patterns at all sites (@fig-tkn-boxplots). At Pine Island, there is a distinctive pattern of very low values between January-March and elevated levels from April-July (@fig-tkn-boxplots-1). This distinctive shift between March and April may likely be in response to the large levels of rainfall the system experienced in March (@fig-rainfall-2). This response was seen at all the other sites, especially Pellicer Creek, which is also a more brackish site and sensitive to upland freshwater deposition (@fig-tkn-boxplots-2).\n\n### Total Nitrogen\n\nTN is a calculated value based on TKN and NO23.\n\nThis year, quite a bit of the NO23 values fell below the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Central Lab's minimum detection limit and therefore TN was not able to be calculated and is missing for quite a few months in a several of the stations (@fig-tn-boxplots). This was especially true at Fort Matanzas which has the least amount of TN data (@fig-tn-boxplots-3).\n\n\n::: {#fig-tn-boxplots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pine Island](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tn-boxplots-1.png){#fig-tn-boxplots-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![San Sebastian](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tn-boxplots-2.png){#fig-tn-boxplots-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fort Matanzas](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tn-boxplots-3.png){#fig-tn-boxplots-3 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pellicer Creek](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tn-boxplots-4.png){#fig-tn-boxplots-4 width=672}\n:::\n\nHistorical monthly total nitrogen at each SWMP water quality station with current year monthly value overlaid in red.

Due to the low or undetectable levels of NO23, DIN is also missing quite a bit of information for this year (@fig-din-boxplots).\n\n\n::: {#fig-din-boxplots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pine Island](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-din-boxplots-1.png){#fig-din-boxplots-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![San Sebastian](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-din-boxplots-2.png){#fig-din-boxplots-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fort Matanzas](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-din-boxplots-3.png){#fig-din-boxplots-3 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pellicer Creek](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-din-boxplots-4.png){#fig-din-boxplots-4 width=672}\n:::\n\nHistorical monthly dissolved inorganic nitrogen at each SWMP water quality station with current year monthly value overlaid in red.\n:::\n\n\n### Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen\n\nTKN is the total concentration of organic nitrogen and ammonia.

Though below the state threshold, Pine Island experienced elevated TP levels April-July (@fig-tp-boxplots-1). Total phosphorus levels were typically much lower than average at the remaining sites during that same time period. In general, orthophosphate levels typically fell within the historical ranges at all sites; however, elevated amounts were observed in April at all four stations (@fig-po4-boxplots).\n\n### Total Phosphorus\n\n\n::: {#fig-tp-boxplots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pine Island](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tp-boxplots-1.png){#fig-tp-boxplots-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![San Sebastian](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tp-boxplots-2.png){#fig-tp-boxplots-2 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fort Matanzas](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tp-boxplots-3.png){#fig-tp-boxplots-3 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pellicer Creek](nut-indicators_files/figure-html/fig-tp-boxplots-4.png){#fig-tp-boxplots-4 width=672}\n:::\n\nHistorical monthly total phosphorus at each SWMP water quality station with current year monthly value overlaid in red.
