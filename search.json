    "text": "The System-Wide Monitoring Program\nUnderstanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

Discrete water samples are collected monthly for nutrients and other parameters at these same four stations, with an additional diel sampler deployed at one station. To complement the water quality data, the GTMNERR also operates and maintains one continuous meteorological station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll SWMP data are publicly available for download through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO).

    "text": "1.2 Locations\nThe climate of Northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions. The weather station is located near the mouth of Pellicer Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: SWMP Water Quality Stations"

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at (https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Grab samples were collected from all stations in duplicate using a pole sampler and bucket. Diel samples were only collected at the Pellicer Creek station at 2.5-hour intervals for a 25-hour (lunar day) period using a Teledyne ISCO automatic sampler equipped with an internal ice bath to keep samples cold. Both grab and diel samples were collected from the approximate depth of the sonde sensors, 1 m above the bottom. Samples were filtered in the field whenever feasible; otherwise, they were placed on ice in the dark and filtered immediately upon returning to the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Grab sample collection using sampling pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Diel sampler deployed at Pellicer Creek station.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Collection methods for nutrient analyses\n\n\nWater samples collected between January 1, 2003 and June 30, 2010 were collected and analyzed by University of Florida’s (UF) Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

Samples collected on or after December 1, 2012 were collected by GTMNERR and analyzed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s (FDEP) Central Laboratory. Both laboratories were certified through the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program and used the American Public Health Association and Environmental Protection Agency methods for analyses.

    "text": "From 2003–2006, SWMP data underwent a two-step QA/QC process (secondary and tertiary) using protocols outlined in the CDMO’s Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2006). The secondary QA/QC process was performed by GTMNERR staff and involved performing basic statistical analysis, processing the data using macros distributed by the CDMO, and plotting data to look for suspect or anomalous data. Anomalous data were evaluated to determine whether values were: 1) outside the expected range for the site, or 2) outside the range of measurements established by YSI for the sensors. Data were investigated for validity based on weather and field observations, quality control checks, graphs, and instrument diagnostics. Yearly data files were compiled, and data were deleted if anomalies were attributed to sensor malfunctions. Other anomalous data were marked as suspect in the accompanying yearly metadata document. Both the annual data file and metadata were submitted to the CDMO for archiving and review. The CDMO evaluated the reserve’s findings by performing a tertiary review process. The tertiary process included evaluating the files for completeness, ensuring that supporting documentation was submitted, and offering suggestions for improvements to the data. All data files collected prior to 2007 are referred to as “historic” data files by the CDMO. Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to present, all SWMP data files undergo a three-step QA/QC protocol outlined in the CDMO Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2015). In addition to the secondary and tertiary processes listed above, data files undergo a primary QA/QC process, in which an automated QA/QC is performed by the CDMO upon the upload of the raw data file using the CDMO’s Data Upload Service.\nOnce tertiary review is completed for data files, they are referred to as “authenticated” data. All data files used in this report have been authenticated with the exception of nutrient data collected in 2013 and 2015-present, which have not undergone tertiary review. Historic data files were edited to include the updated QA/QC protocols that were implemented by the CDMO in 2007. Standardized QA/QC flags and codes were applied to the historic data files using finalized metadata reports. These files were updated to include suspect data flags and codes to keep consistency among all data files. Rejected and suspect data were removed from the data files prior to analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll water quality and weather data used in this report are downloadable through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office using their data portals. However, much of the nutrient data presented in this report is not fully available through the CDMO. For those wishing to access this data, please contact the GTM Research Reserve SWMP Manager Shannon Dunnigan at Shannon.Dunnigan@FloridaDEP.gov for the data."

    "text": "4.1 Summary\nIn July, northeast Florida received consistent and large amounts of precipitation (Figure 4.1). Almost 61% of days in July had detectable levels of rainfall (Figure 4.1 (b)) and it also had the most amount of heavy rain (7.6 - 50 mm/hr) (Figure 4.1 (c)). After the summer rains, however, early fall (September - October) was pretty minimal with very few rain days (rain greater than 1 mm) (Figure 4.1 (b)). However, even though there were not many rainy days in October at the weather station, all the rainfall for the month was collected on one day: October 12, 2023 (Figure 4.1 (a)). Nor’easters brought heavy rainfall in March, April, June, and December (Figure 4.1 (a); Figure 4.1 (b)). These events are discussed in further detail in the next chapter.\nIn 2023, the average daily amount of light intensity for each month is shown in Figure 4.2. There was less intense light in the extreme months of the year (Jan, Feb, Nov, Dec) and more in the mid-months of the year. The most intense light was observed between April - August.\nDaily average air temperatures were high and variable during the first part of the year, particularly in February, but fell within the historical range for the GTMNERR station through October (Figure 4.3). October also experienced a few temperature drops outside of the average range (Figure 4.3). More discussions on temperature anomalies can be found in the next chapter.\nWater temperatures have generally been on the higher end of the range throughout the year (Figure 4.4). Temperatures have been most variable and lower at stations most influenced by freshwater runoff (Pine Island and Pellicer Creek). Daily averages fell within historical ranges at the stations within June, but all stations experienced higher temperatures in July and August (Figure 4.4). The cooler weather in October also is evident in the water temperatures as clear drops in daily averages were observed at all four stations, though more pronounced at Pellicer Creek, the shallowest of the four stations (Figure 4.4 (d)).\nThe heavy summer rains brought salinities at all stations much lower than their average daily ranges (Figure 4.5), particularly at the stations farthest from the inlets (Figure 4.5 (a); Figure 4.5 (d)). Nor’easters and fall “King Tides” did help to raise salinities often at most sites, particularly April in Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.5 (d)) and September-October at all sites."

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nMost of the stations reported daily average dissolved oxygen values on the lower end of their average ranges in the first quarter of the year (Figure 5.1), generally coinciding with the higher temperatures observed during the same period of time (Figure 4.4). Daily averages fell outside average ranges at Pine Island several times throughout the year (Figure 5.1 (a)). When temperatures were warmer (Jan-Mar, Aug), the values were lower than the average limit. After the cooler weather in October and the various weather events in the fall (Nor’easters and King Tides), the daily dissolved oxygen values increased above the average range. This year saw some of the lowest and most prolonged periods of dissolved oxygen at Pine Island in the last five years (Figure 5.2). Values fell below the 2 mg/L hypoxia threshold several times a day and for multiple days in August (Figure 5.2 (b); Table 5.1).\nPellicer Creek frequently experiences low dissolved oxygen events annually (Figure 5.3 (a)) and this year was no exception. Though daily averages were relatively within the average daily range (Figure 5.1 (d)), closer inspection of the continuous data show several low dissolved oxygen events in July and August, in particular (Figure 5.3 (b)). The duration of these events were often not long and not as frequent as Pine Island (Table 5.2).\nChlorophyll a values were often higher than average at all stations this year (Figure 5.4). Chlorophyll a at Pine Island more often fell above the state threshold (6.6 \\(\\mu\\)g/L) than below and record monthly high values were observed in January (7.0 \\(\\mu\\)g/L), March (9.8 \\(\\mu\\)g/L), and September (12 \\(\\mu\\)g/L) (Figure 5.4 (a)). San Sebastian also saw high chlorophyll a for every month except November and December (data of which is not included in this report at this time) with a record high in January of 7.3 \\(\\mu\\)g/L. November, however, was much lower than normal at this station (Figure 5.4 (b)). Elevated chlorophyll a was observed from May through July at Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.4 (c)). Pellicer Creek was consistently high for most of the year, with a record value in March (14.5 \\(\\mu\\)g/L), but experienced lower than normal ranges in October and November (Figure 5.4 (d)). Annual geometric mean (AGM) chlorophyll a values were high and above the state threshold levels at all sites except for Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.5). These values do not include data from December 2023 as that data has not been received from the laboratory as of the current edition of this report. Therefore, these values are likely to change following the addition of the final month of the year.\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated. At Pine Island and Pellicer Creek, however, high TN was observed in the high rainfall months of July and August and also in November (Figure 5.6). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) was lower than average for most stations; however, all stations experienced higher levels in May, August, and November (Figure 5.8).\nTotal phosphorus continues to fall below the state threshold for every station and similar to TKN, all stations experienced elevated values of total phosphorus and orthophosphate in May (Figure 5.9; Figure 5.10). Relatively high levels of orthophosphate were observed at Pine Island January through May and again in August (Figure 5.10 (a))."

    "section": "6.2 Nor’easters",
    "text": "6.2 Nor’easters\nTypically, a Nor’easter is a storm along the East Coast of the United States with predominating winds from the northeast. These storms can last anywhere from a single day (24 hours) to several days or weeks. Callahan, Leathers, and Callahan (2022) found that these events can produce surges just as severe as tropical cyclone events, and occur much more frequently. These events are often in the news associated with blizzards in the New England area of the US; however, their impacts to northeast Florida are not insignificant. Often these storms bring higher water levels, heavy prevailing winds, precipitation, and reduced tidal exchange.\nUsing duration of wind directions between 0-100 degrees for greater than 24-hrs, several “Nor’easter” events were identified using data from the Pellicer Creek weather station (Table 6.1). Occasionally, localized wind directions result in values outside of this 0-100 degree window, which in turn affects the duration calculations, but it appears that there were at least 11-14 possible Nor’easter events identified in this way for 2023. The longest event occurred in the second half of the year from September 28th - October 6th, approximately nine days. This table does not identify strength of the winds during these events, just the time frames in which winds were originating and prevailing in the 0-100 degree directions. When examining daily median wind speeds over the year, the highest values are most often associated with winds in the north-northeast (NNE) and east-northeast (ENE) directions (Figure 6.1).\nThe April Nor’easter had strong winds from the N and NE directions for four days (Figure 6.2). Strong winds from all of the Nor’easters initially raised salinity at all stations (Figure 4.5), and the effect was especially pronounced at Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.5 (d)). After the winds died down, the effects of the heavy rainfall were evident in the drops in salinity following the storm events. Compared to the Nor’easter in April, the longest one that occurred between September 27 - October 6, 2023 did not have as high of winds for quite as long, but they were from the NNE and ENE directions for a much longer period of time (Figure 6.3).\n\n\n\nWeather Service Image from Flagler Live showing the wind speed predictions for the April Nor'easter\n\n\nMany of these events correspond to months with rainfall totals exceeding the annual monthly average (Figure 4.1 (b)), particularly months within the “drier” times of the year, such as April, November, and December. The heaviest rain (7.6-50 mm/hr) for April, June, and December were all associated with Nor’easter events (Figure 4.1 (c)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Identification and Duration of Wind from 0-100 degrees for periods greater than 24 hours\n\n\nStart Time\nEnd Time\nDuration (hrs)\n\n\n\n\n2023-03-08 05:30:00\n2023-03-09 11:30:00\n30.25\n\n\n2023-03-20 11:30:00\n2023-03-21 15:45:00\n28.50\n\n\n2023-03-29 07:30:00\n2023-03-30 19:45:00\n36.50\n\n\n2023-04-09 07:45:00\n2023-04-11 03:15:00\n43.75\n\n\n2023-04-23 01:45:00\n2023-04-24 17:15:00\n39.75\n\n\n2023-05-23 21:45:00\n2023-05-26 16:00:00\n66.50\n\n\n2023-05-31 07:15:00\n2023-06-04 01:45:00\n90.75\n\n\n2023-06-04 06:45:00\n2023-06-06 00:15:00\n41.75\n\n\n2023-08-23 09:15:00\n2023-08-25 01:15:00\n40.25\n\n\n2023-09-02 10:00:00\n2023-09-03 23:45:00\n38.00\n\n\n2023-09-18 10:15:00\n2023-09-19 18:30:00\n32.50\n\n\n2023-09-28 10:30:00\n2023-09-30 08:15:00\n46.00\n\n\n2023-09-30 10:45:00\n2023-10-02 06:45:00\n44.25\n\n\n2023-10-02 07:15:00\n2023-10-04 03:30:00\n44.50\n\n\n2023-10-04 06:30:00\n2023-10-06 02:45:00\n44.50\n\n\n2023-11-01 11:00:00\n2023-11-03 03:00:00\n40.25\n\n\n2023-12-13 18:15:00\n2023-12-15 08:30:00\n38.50\n\n\n2023-12-19 14:00:00\n2023-12-20 15:30:00\n25.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Daily median wind speeds observed in 2023 at the Pellicer Creek weather station.

    "text": "6.3 King Tides\n“King Tides” are the highest predicted tides of the year and in northeast Florida, these typically occur during the fall months. For the city of St. Augustine, these events often bring nuisance flooding in coastal and low-lying areas. For the estuary, this typically also means reduced tidal exchange, a lack of low tide events, and more and prolonged flooding in the intertidal wetlands. The city reports these events on their website.\nPredicted king tide events for 2023 were:\n\nSeptember 26-30th\nOctober 1st-3rd\nOctober 27th-31st\nNovember 25-28th\nDecember 13-15th\n\nThe effect of the King Tides on daily average water depths at all the stations is observable in the steady climb of the water beginning in mid-September (Figure 6.4); however, the individual “events” are not quite as clear outside of the Pellicer Creek station (Figure 6.4 (d)) where clear increases in water levels are closely aligned with these periods. Unfortunately, September King Tide, which was coupled with a Nor’easter, was not captured at this station due to equipment maintenance issues.\n\n6.3.1 Water Depth\nNote that the water level data at Pellicer Creek only includes data from 2021-2023, which is due to this station switching from reporting depth to reporting level (NAVD88) in 2021 (Figure 6.4 (d)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Historical daily range of water depth at each SWMP water quality station with current year daily average overlaid in blue."

    "text": "6.4 Temperature anomalies\nExtreme temperatures, both high and low, have drastic impacts on environmental function. For black mangroves (Avicennia germinans), temperatures under -4°C have been found to reduce mangrove cover (Cavanaugh et al. 2013). Extreme high temperatures are often health risks as they result in many heat-related illnesses.\nOverall, examining monthly temperature anomalies this year, the first part of the year (January - April) and August were higher than “normal” (Figure 6.5). With February of this year almost setting a record on the time series (2018 had the hottest February). May, June, and October were “cooler” than normal.\nDue to news reports of extremely high temperatures in the summer months this year, a comparison was made of previous data for the months of June and July with average dew point (°C) and average air temperature (°C) with total monthly precipitation (mm) (Figure 6.6). The greater the dew point, the greater the moisture in the air. This year, 2023, is indicated in red. This year, 2023, has been one of the hotter and wetter summers on record (Figure 6.6).\nIn Florida, excessive heat warnings are issued with the heat index (what the temperature “feels like”, which takes relative humidity into consideration) exceeds 113 degrees. The Pellicer Creek station recorded several times when the hourly average heat index exceeded this threshold (Figure 6.7), particularly in August.\nHeat waves are periods of abnormally hot weather that extend for more than two days. But what [makes a heat wave?](https://www.stormgeo.com/weather/articles/what-constitutes-a-heat-wave-around-the-world/#:~:text=In%20the%20Northeast%20United%20States,F%20(32.2%20%C2%B0C).

All stations had higher DOC levels in the July-August period.\nBacteria is detected in water samples from Pellicer Creek more often and in higher quantities than the other three stations (Figure 7.2 (a); Figure 7.2 (b)). Fecal coliforms are also often detected at San Sebastian (Figure 7.2 (b)). So far this year, bacteria samples were frequently reported at the minimum detection limit for all stations except for July and September."

The datasonde will need to be sent in for repair as one of the sensor pins was sheared off in the bulkhead - likely due to excessive power draw from the Central Wiper, coupled with electrolysis. Sensors will all need to be either evaluated (turbidity, central wiper) or replaced (WCT, DO).\nSD card failed during deployment of sonde at San Sebastian (“Triton” SN: 13K102679) 11/29/2023 12:00 - 12/12/2023 10:00 which was likely a result of a failing central wiper (SN: 13H102597).

Investigating the data file revealed a steady and sharp decline in battery voltage with each measurement until insufficient voltage remained to power the sonde through a deployment. At post-calibration it gave “internal battery voltage is below 0.9V per cell” error and after replacing with alternative batteries, passed post-calibration checks. Evaluation revealed no issue with with the sensors or sonde itself. YSI Service Technicians recommended redeploying the sonde in the lab for a couple of days and check the data for rapid battery drain as it could have been faulty batteries. The sonde was deployed for a week in the lab with no data collection or battery power issues. Therefore, it appears it was a bad batch of batteries. In the future, before tossing the batteries into the junk bin, they will be evaluated with a volt meter. Unfortunately, they were tossed into the bin first this time and they could not be evaluated."

No depth data was collected during deployment, nor was the depth sensor connected and readable during post-calibrations. After contacting YSI for tips on how to reconnect to the sensor (they are internal to the instruments), performed the suggested hard reset by removing the batteries from the compartment and reconnected to EXO Handheld - the depth sensor came back. When attempted to calibrate the sonde for redeployment on November 27, the depth sensor failed to stabilize. The sonde was not used and was packed up for evaluation and repair.\nThe depth sensor dropped from deployment of sonde (“Egret” SN: 15E101700) from December 12, 2023 - January 10, 2024 at Pellicer Creek. This resulted in a broken deployment file at 12/17/23 04:30 in which the depth sensor was completely missing from the second half of this split file. During post-calibrations, the battery compartment was reset (removed battery cap and replaced it) and the depth sensor was reconnected to the datasonde. Post-calibration values were able to be collected and a calibration test of the sensor showed that it was able to be stabilized. Therefore, this sensor and sonde will be redeployed."
