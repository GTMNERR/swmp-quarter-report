    "text": "The System-Wide Monitoring Program\nUnderstanding the importance of estuaries, the federal government established a network of National Estuarine Research Reserves through the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972. The Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTMNERR) was designated in 1999 and encompasses more than 30,000 hectares of coastal habitats in Northeast Florida. Currently, GTMNERR is one of 30 reserves established to serve as a living laboratory for staff, students, visiting scientists, and anyone who is interested in learning more about coastal ecosystems. Research conducted throughout the reserve addresses specific coastal management needs that support national, regional, and local interests. To learn more about the GTMNERR, visit https://floridadep.gov/rcp/nerr-gtm and https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/reserves/gtm.html.\nIn 1995 the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) established the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) to track and understand short-term variability and long-term change within our nation’s estuaries. The primary function of SWMP is the standardized collection and analysis of long-term data related to management issues, which helps to better inform decision-makers and improve our understanding of the issues affecting estuaries and coastal watersheds (SWMP Plan, 2011). The longest running components of the SWMP at the GTMNERR are weather and water quality monitoring, which began in December 2000. Newer SWMP protocols for habitat mapping and emergent vegetation were initiated about a decade later."

    "text": "1.1 Station Information\nThe continuous water quality component of the SWMP is comprised of four fixed monitoring stations, at which automated instruments (data sondes) are deployed to continuously collect information on a suite of water quality parameters. Discrete water samples are collected monthly for nutrients and other parameters at these same four stations, with an additional diel sampler deployed at one station. To complement the water quality data, the GTMNERR also operates and maintains one continuous meteorological station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll SWMP data are publicly available for download through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO).

    "text": "1.2 Locations\nThe climate of Northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Southeastern United States. The GTMNERR is in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin and includes over 30,000 hectares of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, estuarine lagoons, and offshore seas. It is associated with the riverine systems of the Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River and Pellicer Creek estuaries to the south. Until recently, the reserve was comprised of northern and southern components geographically separated by the greater St. Augustine area (Figure 1.1). In March of 2020, the boundary was expanded to include the Intracoastal Waterway through the City of St. Augustine, connecting the two components.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of location for water quality, which includes data sonde and monthly grab samples for nutrients, and weather stations within the GTM Research Reserve. The red line represents the boundary of the GTM Research Reserve and the sites are indicated with a blue pin. The sites are named based on the nomenclature of the NERRs SWMP.\n\n\n\nThe four SWMP water quality stations operated in the GTMNERR are Pine Island, San Sebastian, Fort Matanzas, and Pellicer Creek (Figure 1.2). The locations of these stations were selected to represent the influence of watersheds with varying degrees of urban development and reflect a diversity of physical processes (e.g., tidal exchange, freshwater input) and climatic conditions. The weather station is located near the mouth of Pellicer Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pine Island\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) San Sebastian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fort Matanzas\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Pellicer Creek\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: SWMP Water Quality Stations"

    "text": "1.3 Characteristics\nThe Pine Island water quality station (Figure 1.2 (a)) is located at Channel Marker 25 in the Tolomato River (30.0508 N; -81.3674 W), adjacent to Pine Island and near the mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from silviculture-dominated uplands in the northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin. The station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters. Also located within the Tolomato River Basin are both the Guana River Marsh Aquatic Preserve and the Guana River. The Guana River runs parallel to the Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 11.3 km north of the St. Augustine Inlet. The Tolomato River Basin converges with the Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.\nThe San Sebastian water quality station (Figure 1.2 (b)) is approximately 4 km south of the St. Augustine Inlet at the confluence of the San Sebastian and Matanzas Rivers on Channel Marker 1 (29.8688 N; -81.3074 W). The San Sebastian River drains an urbanized watershed in the western portion of St. Augustine, which is characterized by both residential and commercial development, including five marinas.\nThe Matanzas River estuary is approximately 32 km in length and extends 13 km south of the Matanzas Inlet. Both the St. Augustine and Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system. The Matanzas Inlet, one of the last “natural” inlets on Florida’s east coast, has been unimproved and is suitable only for small watercrafts. The Fort Matanzas water quality station (Figure 1.2 (c)) is located at Channel Marker 75 in the Matanzas River approximately 4 km north of the Matanzas Inlet (29.7370 N; -81.2459 W). This station is within Class II shellfish harvesting waters and is bordered to the east by residential development on Anastasia Island.\nPellicer Creek is located in the southern part of the Matanzas River Basin, serves as a border between St. Johns and Flagler counties, and is surrounded by public conservation lands. Pellicer Creek is a tidal creek and is the primary source of natural freshwater drainage into the Matanzas River. The Pellicer Creek water quality station (Figure 1.2 (d)) is at the end of a recreational dock in Faver-Dykes State Park located within the Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve (29.6671 N; -81.2574 W). The Pellicer Creek weather station (Figure 1.3) is approximately 4 km southeast of the Pellicer Creek water quality station, at the mouth of Pellicer Creek in Princess Place Preserve in Flagler County (29.6578 N, -81.2328 W). The station is located on a 1.8-m2 wooden deck built 1.3 m above a sand flat in a high marsh habitat. Excluding the rain gauge, which is located away from the tower on the southeast corner of the platform, all sensors are mounted on a 3-m aluminum tower secured to the wooden deck. Data collected at the water quality and weather stations in Pellicer Creek are transmitted via telemetry and are available for viewing online in near real-time at www.nerrsdata.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Pellicer Creek Weather Station"

The precipitation sensor measured 15-min totals. Historically, a CR10x-2M logger was used to collect meteorological data. The CR10X-2M logger sampled all weather station sensors every 5 sec and calculated both hourly and daily averages for air temperature, wind direction, and wind speed. Additionally, instantaneous samples of these parameters were recorded every 15 min. Precipitation data were summed and recorded as 15-minute, hourly, and daily totals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Weather Station at Pellicer Creek during a monthy data download and station cleaning and maintenance in September, 2020.\n\n\nA maximum four-week sampling interval (i.e., time between data downloads) was used to avoid losing data and to provide for regular inspection and maintenance of the station. At each visit to the station, sensor performance was checked by comparing weather station values to those of a handheld Kestrel 4000 wind/weather instrument. All sensors were inspected for damage or debris and repaired and cleaned accordingly after the download of data were downloaded to a Palm Pilot. Except for the rain gauge (which was calibrated in-house), all sensors were removed and sent to Campbell Scientific for re-calibration when appropriate. In addition to data obtained directly from the data logger, data were also transmitted via Campbell Scientific telemetry equipment to a NOAA GOES satellite hourly."

    "text": "2.2 Water quality – continuous\nThe continuous water quality stations were equipped with YSI 6-Series Multiparameter (2003-2015) and YSI EXO2 (2015-present) data sondes. The sondes were anchored within a 10-cm (inside diameter) PVC housing pipe mounted vertically onto a piling. Either a steel pin at the bottom of the pipe held the sonde at a position within 1 m from the bottom, or the sonde was suspended by a chain or rope such that the sensor portion of the sonde extended beyond the end of the PVC housing 1 m from the bottom. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2-cm holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe. Hole density was greatest near the base where the sonde sensors were located.\nData sonde exchanges at all stations were made at approximately two-week intervals and usually took less than five minutes. The inside of each deployment tube was scraped clean with a customized tool prior to the deployment of the newly calibrated sonde. All calibration, post-deployment readings, and reconditioning of the sondes and sensors were performed in accordance with the methods outlined in the standard operating procedures for the sonde model, in addition to procedures created by the NERRS CDMO (NERRS, 2013).\nData sondes collected temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth (water depth above instrument placement), and turbidity data at 30-min intervals, beginning at the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas monitoring stations in December 2000 and at the San Sebastian and Pellicer Creek monitoring stations in February 2002. In January 2007, the NERRS changed from collecting continuous data at 30-min intervals to 15-min intervals. Data used in this report contain both sampling intervals."

Grab samples were collected from all stations in duplicate using a pole sampler and bucket. Diel samples were only collected at the Pellicer Creek station at 2.5-hour intervals for a 25-hour (lunar day) period using a Teledyne ISCO automatic sampler equipped with an internal ice bath to keep samples cold. Both grab and diel samples were collected from the approximate depth of the sonde sensors, 1 m above the bottom. Samples were filtered in the field whenever feasible; otherwise, they were placed on ice in the dark and filtered immediately upon returning to the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Grab sample collection using sampling pole.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Diel sampler deployed at Pellicer Creek station.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Collection methods for nutrient analyses\n\n\nWater samples collected between January 1, 2003 and June 30, 2010 were collected and analyzed by University of Florida’s (UF) Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

    "section": "",
    "text": "From 2003–2006, SWMP data underwent a two-step QA/QC process (secondary and tertiary) using protocols outlined in the CDMO’s Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2006). The secondary QA/QC process was performed by GTMNERR staff and involved performing basic statistical analysis, processing the data using macros distributed by the CDMO, and plotting data to look for suspect or anomalous data. Anomalous data were evaluated to determine whether values were: 1) outside the expected range for the site, or 2) outside the range of measurements established by YSI for the sensors. Data were investigated for validity based on weather and field observations, quality control checks, graphs, and instrument diagnostics. Yearly data files were compiled, and data were deleted if anomalies were attributed to sensor malfunctions. Other anomalous data were marked as suspect in the accompanying yearly metadata document. Both the annual data file and metadata were submitted to the CDMO for archiving and review. The CDMO evaluated the reserve’s findings by performing a tertiary review process. The tertiary process included evaluating the files for completeness, ensuring that supporting documentation was submitted, and offering suggestions for improvements to the data. All data files collected prior to 2007 are referred to as “historic” data files by the CDMO. Beginning in January 2007 and continuing to present, all SWMP data files undergo a three-step QA/QC protocol outlined in the CDMO Data Management Manual (NERRS, 2015). In addition to the secondary and tertiary processes listed above, data files undergo a primary QA/QC process, in which an automated QA/QC is performed by the CDMO upon the upload of the raw data file using the CDMO’s Data Upload Service.\nOnce tertiary review is completed for data files, they are referred to as “authenticated” data. All data files used in this report have been authenticated with the exception of nutrient data collected in 2013 and 2015-present, which have not undergone tertiary review. Historic data files were edited to include the updated QA/QC protocols that were implemented by the CDMO in 2007. Standardized QA/QC flags and codes were applied to the historic data files using finalized metadata reports. These files were updated to include suspect data flags and codes to keep consistency among all data files. Rejected and suspect data were removed from the data files prior to analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll water quality and weather data used in this report are downloadable through the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office using their data portals. However, much of the nutrient data presented in this report is not fully available through the CDMO. For those wishing to access this data, please contact the GTM Research Reserve SWMP Manager Shannon Dunnigan at Shannon.Dunnigan@FloridaDEP.gov for the data."

    "text": "4.1 Summary\nNor’easters brought heavy rainfall in March, April, and June (Figure 4.1 (a); Figure 4.1 (b)). In July, northeast Florida received consistent and large amounts of precipitation ((Figure 4.1 (a); Figure 4.1 (b)). Almost 61% of days in July had detectable levels of rainfall (Figure 4.1 (b)). After the summer rains, however, early fall (September - October) was pretty minimal with very few rain days (rain greater than 1 mm) (Figure 4.1 (b)).\nDaily average air temperatures were high and variable during the first part of the year, but daily averages fell within the historical range for the GTMNERR station through October (Figure 4.2 (a)). However, when comparing monthly averages in June and July to previous years, 2023 has been one of the hotter and wetter summers on record (Figure 4.2 (b)). October also experienced a few temperature drops outside of the average range, but only for a short time as values returned to the higher end of the range within a few days (Figure 4.2 (a)).\nWater temperatures have generally been on the higher end of the range throughout the year (Figure 4.3). Temperatures have been most variable and lower at stations most influenced by freshwater runoff (Pine Island and Pellicer Creek). Daily averages fell within historical ranges at the stations within June, but all stations experienced higher temperatures in July and August (Figure 4.3). The cooler weather in October also is evident in the water temperatures as clear drops in daily averages were observed at all four stations, though more pronounced at Pellicer Creek, the shallowest of the four stations (Figure 4.3 (d)).\nThe April Nor’easter had strong winds from the N and NE directions for four days (Figure 4.5). Strong winds from all of the Nor’easters initially raised salinity at all stations (Figure 4.4), and the effect was especially pronounced at Pellicer Creek (Figure 4.4 (d)). After the winds died down, the effects of the heavy rainfall were evident in the drops in salinity following the storm events. Though not much rainfall was observed in October, the Nor’easters and seasonal “king tide” events did see higher water depths and lower salinities at all sites (Figure 4.4; Figure 4.6).\n\n\n\nWeather Service Image from Flagler Live showing the wind speed predictions for the April Nor'easter\n\n\nAs a result of strong N-NE winds, increases in water depths/levels were observed at all stations during the periods of the Nor’easters (Figure 4.6)."

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nWaters at all stations were oxygenated following spring rainfall events and Nor’easters (Figure 4.1 (b); Figure 5.1); however, dissolved oxygen was lower than average from late January through mid-March at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek and again at the end July at Pine Island (Figure 5.1 (a); Figure 5.1 (b)). This pattern is likely correlated with the warmer than average temperatures this area experienced during this time (Figure 4.2; Figure 4.3). Pellicer Creek had daily average dissolved oxygen values that fell within normal ranges (Figure 5.1 (d)), however continuous data show low dissolved oxygen values in several months: June, July, August, and September (Figure 5.2). Pine Island has experienced very low dissolved oxygen values (less than 2 mg/L) frequently in the past two years, which is uncharacteristic for this station, particularly in the past five years (Figure 5.3). This August was especially pronounced with prolonged periods in poor conditions (Figure 5.3 (b)). Table 5.1 and Table 5.2 show the hypoxia events and duration (more than 0.5 hrs) at Pine Island and Pellicer Creek for this year.\nChlorophyll a values were higher than average at all stations from January through May (Figure 5.4), frequently over the state thresholds. Although too soon to make inferences, so far the data shows elevated annual geometric means of chlorophyll a at all stations except Fort Matanzas (Figure 5.5). Chlorophyll a at Pine Island continues to remain exceptionally high with this year seeing record monthly high values for January (7.0 \\(\\mu\\)g/L), March (9.8 \\(\\mu\\)g/L), and September (12 \\(\\mu\\)g/L).\nInterpretations of patterns in total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are difficult this year since quite a bit of the values were not able to be calculated. At Pine Island and Pellicer Creek, however, high TN was observed in the high rainfall months of July and August (Figure 5.6). Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) was lower than average for most stations; however, all stations experienced higher levels in May and August (Figure 5.8).\nTotal phosphorus continues to fall below the state threshold for every station and similar to TKN, all stations experienced elevated values of total phosphorus and orthophosphate in May (Figure 5.9; Figure 5.10). Relatively high levels of orthophosphate were observed at Pine Island January through May and again in August (Figure 5.10)."

Investigating the data file revealed a steady and sharp decline in battery voltage with each measurement until insufficient voltage remained to power the sonde through a deployment. At post-calibration it gave “internal battery voltage is below 0.9V per cell” error and after replacing with alternative batteries, passed post-calibration checks. Evaluation revealed no issue with with the sensors or sonde itself. YSI Service Technicians recommended redeploying the sonde in the lab for a couple of days and check the data for rapid battery drain as it could have been faulty batteries. The sonde was deployed for a week in the lab with no data collection or battery power issues. Therefore, it appears it was a bad batch of batteries. In the future, before tossing the batteries into the junk bin, they will be evaluated with a volt meter. Unfortunately, they were tossed into the bin first this time and they could not be evaluated."
